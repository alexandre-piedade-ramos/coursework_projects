**Course**: Operating systems\
I have mixed feelings about this one.\
Operating systems was one of my favorite courses, but despte managing to pass all tests, the code quality fell short, particularly in handling thread returns.\
A key lesson of the course was the im+portance of thoroughly reading the documentation.
