**Course**: Operating systems\
The first part of the OS project focused on race conditions between multiple threads.\
I have mixed feelings about this one.\
Operating systems was one of my favorite courses, but despite managing to pass all tests, the code quality fell short, particularly in handling thread returns.\
A key lesson of the course was the importance of thoroughly reading the documentation.
